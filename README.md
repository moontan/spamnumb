========

SpamNumb is a collection of annoying solicitation and message spam phone numbers in VCF-format. Currently there is only one VCF-card containing numbers in Taiwan. If you are in Taiwan add this to your contacts and you or some number blocking app can decide whether to accept the call/message or reject it based on this contact info.

In this last update the VCF data was modified in such a way that one cann tell from each number's type when it was used and identified as spam. This way the file can be easily cleaned of old numbers who might have changed owners and aren't spam any more. I'm not too sure but I suggest the numbers stay in here for 18 to 24 months.

If you have similar lists for other countries please add them to complete the collection.
